        Recognizing the prevalence of violence in today's world, we decided to
        develop a dedicated tool designed specifically for children. Our goal is
        to eliminate violent content, ensuring their safety, shielding them from
        harmful exposure, and protecting their mental well-being from potential
        psychological impacts.
