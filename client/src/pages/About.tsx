          Recognizing the prevalence of violence in today's world, we decided to
          develop a dedicated tool designed specifically for children. Our goal
          is to eliminate violent content, ensuring their safety, shielding them
          from harmful exposure and protecting their mental well-being from
          potential psychological impacts.
